# Create structure script

[`create_day.sh`](create_day.sh) is a script that creates a new day structure for you. It creates a new package for the day, a new Kotlin file for the day's puzzle, and a new Kotlin test file for the day's puzzle.

1. Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x create_day.sh
```

2. Run the script:

   - With a specific day:

   ```bash
   ./create_day.sh 1
   ```

   - Or for the current day (default):

   ```bash
   ./create_day.sh
   ```
